What is jQuery?
jQuery is a JavaScript library with tons of cool features delivering outstanding results to the developers out there. It is fast, concise, lightweight and very easy to use compared to the actual JavaScript.
jQuery also simplifies a lot of the complicated things from JavaScript, like AJAX calls and DOM manipulation.
The jQuery library contains the following features:

   1. HTML/DOM manipulation
   2. CSS manipulation
   3. HTML event methods
   4. Effects and animations
   5. AJAX

The repo will cover each and every topic in detail.
The viewers are requested to copy-n-paste the codes and comment out(wherever necessary) the jQuery part to see the effect of each and every element of jQuery.
